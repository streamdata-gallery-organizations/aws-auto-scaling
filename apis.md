description: Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you
  to scale yourAmazon EC2capacity up or down automatically according to conditions
  you define. You can use Auto Scaling to help ensure that you are running your desired
  number of Amazon EC2 instances. Auto Scaling can also automatically increase the
  number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and
  decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs. Auto Scaling is well suited both
  to applications that have stable demand patterns or that experience hourly, daily,
  or weekly variability in usage.
